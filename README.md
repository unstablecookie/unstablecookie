### http file copy

  Once a colleague asked me "how we can transfer a file from server to another server and be sure that all data was fully copied" and bragged about the sequential file copy process being too slow.
  In response i wrote a simple client - server application over the weekend. Applications use minimal image footprint and basically respond to these questions.
  You can copy files over http, with error report.
  Sender and client work with 4 threads simultaneously.

## my forks

### Emojicon with sound and sound controls

So if you are a big fan of emojicon, you can now enjoy it with music.

~Unfortunately, it can't be merged with the source as the main project is intended for educational purposes only as it is.~
