-**http file copy**
  Once a colleague asked me "how we can transfer a file from server to another server and be sure that all data was fully copied" and bragged about the sequential file copy process being too slow.
  In response i wrote a simple client - server application over the weekend. Applications use minimal image footprint and basically respond to these questions.
  You can copy files over http, with error report.
  Sender and client work with 4 threads simultaneously.

-**telegram bot, will greet users with random wishes**
  Bot will store added users and wishes as POJO in local file (i should use plaintext tho), and greet them on their birthday.
